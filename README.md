i'm the ephemeral rogue. call me fm. i'm also ...
- definitely an imposter
- probably three gerbils, a snake, and an owl in a trenchcoat
- a super shadowy coder
- a relapsed coffee addict
- a multitude
- a contradiction
- innumerable other applicable song lyrics and quotes

generally, i pretend to know what i'm doing but don't actually know what i'm 
doing though i work and write and build as if i know what i'm doing and 
sometimes i get it right.

thanks for dropping in to my little home on github. writing code is generally 
a hobby, as i learned for the sole purpose of booting up support software for 
my online fitness business. i've come to love building shit though, so now i 
find myself tinkering with ideas and different technologies. when i'm writing 
code, i predominantly write backend js, though i have some experience with 
sysadmin shit. i'm currently spending my dev time learning the following systems and
tools:
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs)
- [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [selinux](https://github.blog/2023-07-05-introduction-to-selinux/)
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

and i write all about it on my [sparkling new blog](https://blog.ephemeralrogue.xyz) 
which i'm in the process of migrating from sanity to hashnode. 
follow me on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/ephemeralrogue.xyz) to keep up with my 
latest learning shenanigans, bad takes, strong opinions, and general nonsense.
